# Graphs_And_Football

In this project, I implement Dijkstra's algorithm (similar to Prims' minimum spanning tree algorithm) and a graph with supporting classes for vertices and edges. In this project I explore the nature of greedy algorithms and learn how to use dijkstra's algorithm and other methods associated with graphs to organize vital information about a graph notably the diameter, cycles, and the span of different points on the graph. 

## Key Feautures

- Programmed in Java
- Used List Implementations
- Used Map Implementations
- Used Tree Implementations
- Created and Utilized Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest path 

## Data Structure Class

This course deepened my knowledge of software design through the lenses of an object-oriented perspective. I learned to implemented commmon data structures to organize and manipulate data such as linked lists, recursion, binary trees, and hash tables to list a few. I was made aware of the tradeoffs software developers have to deal with when designing projects and how to handle them. The class also allowed students to explore algorithms and structures in standard code.
