# Graphs_And_Football

In this project, I implement Dijkstra's algorithm (similar to Prims' minimum spanning tree algorithm) and a graph with supporting classes for vertices and edges. In this project I explore the nature of greedy algorithms and learn how to use dijkstra's algorithm and other methods associated with graphs to organize vital information about a graph notably the diameter, cycles, and the span of different points on the graph.

In the bulk of the project we determine the best teams favored to win based on graphs that are formed by teams and the teams they play against.

## Display of Project

### Ranking football teams with UNWEIGHTED paths

We rank each team by counting the number of different teams they are connected to and getting the average number of unweighted paths to those teams.

### Ranking football teams with WEIGHTED paths

We rank each team by counting the number of different teams they are connected to and getting the average number of weighted paths to those teams.

### Ranking football teams with WEIGHTED paths and WIN / LOSS percentage

We rank each team by counting the number of different teams they are connected to and getting the average number of weighted paths to those teams. Afterwards we alter the data by dividing the results with win / loss percentage.

## Data Structure Class

This course deepened my knowledge of software design through the lenses of an object-oriented perspective. I learned to implemented commmon data structures to organize and manipulate data such as linked lists, recursion, binary trees, and hash tables to list a few. I was made aware of the tradeoffs software developers have to deal with when designing projects and how to handle them. The class also allowed students to explore algorithms and structures in standard code.
